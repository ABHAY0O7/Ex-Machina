# Ex-Machina
Hello folks,<br>
Congratulations for qualifying for the second round of Ex-Machina. <br>
This round is very simple you just have to solve the most basic question of Machine Learning. In the .csv file you are given x and y and you have to guess the function that maps x to y.<br>
<b> You need to predict y for x = np.arange(55,60,0.1) with your model and try to minimise MSE for it </b>
The dataset is fairly clean and you don't need to spend much time with cleaning and processing it. We just want you to play with the models you use. <b> 
For the submission create create a colab notebook file and share with these persons only <b>
